Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation semantics of a document written in a markup language
</p>
<p>
CSS most common application is to style web pages written in HTML and XHTML, but the language can also be applied to any kind of XML document.
</p>
<p>
CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts.
</p>
<p>
CSS can also allow the same markup page to be presented in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice and on Braille-based, tactile devices.
